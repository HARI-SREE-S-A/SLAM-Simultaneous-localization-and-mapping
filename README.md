# SLAM-Simultaneous-localization-and-mapping

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a technique used in robotics and computer vision to construct a map of an unknown environment while at the same time locating the robot or camera within the map. The goal of SLAM is to solve the chicken-and-egg problem of navigation: a robot needs a map to know where it is going, but it needs to move around to create a map.

In SLAM, the robot or camera uses sensors such as cameras, laser range finders, or sonar to gather information about the environment. The sensor data is then used to construct a map of the environment, while at the same time estimating the robot's or camera's position within the map. This estimation is done by comparing the sensor data with the map and updating the robot's or camera's position accordingly.

SLAM is a complex problem, and there are many different approaches to solving it. Some approaches use probabilistic techniques such as particle filters or Kalman filters to estimate the robot's or camera's position, while others use optimization techniques such as graph-based methods to optimize the map and the robot's or camera's position.

SLAM has many practical applications, including in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. By creating a map of an environment and simultaneously locating a robot or camera within it, SLAM can enable these systems to navigate and interact with the world more effectively.
